<h1>Agariomods Features</h1>
<ol>
<li>Current Mass
<ul><li>The 'Score' counter in the vanilla game only showed your high score. That has been replaced with a counter of how much mass you currently have, with the 'Score' counter renamed to 'High Score' to the right. 
</ul><li>Connect to server by IP 
<ul><li>Enter an IP into the textbox, under Play button, then click the refresh icon beside it to connect to the server at that IP. 
<li>The IP if the server you are currently on is displayed above the Play button. 
</ul><li>Additional Skins 
<ul><li>This adds additional skins to the game that can be used by using a certain name for your cell. 
<li>These skins are not visible to those who don't use this mod. 
<li>The list of additional skins can be found at http://skins.agariomods.com/ 
</ul><li>Custom Imgur Skins 
<ul><li>Name your cell with the Imgur photo id and 'i/' before it. 
<li>Ex. If your image is http://imgur.com/eCUKe0f.png then your name would be i/eCUKe0f.
<li>The image will only be seen by other users of this mod. 
<li>The name will be hidden for everyone with the mod, i.e. i/eCUKe0f will not show up for other Agariomods users, but will show up for everyone else. 
<li>You can turn this on and off with the "Imgur Skins" setting. Note this will only prevent new skins from being loaded - it does not hide skins that have already been loaded. 
<li>There is <b>no</b> filtering of Imgur images. If you are in an environment where NSFW images can cause issue, it is recommended to disable this feature. If you see a offending image, you should reload the page or connect to a new server, and probably disable imgur images.

<ul><li>Settings are saved automatically every time you make a change.
